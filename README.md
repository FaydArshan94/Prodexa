  ✨ The AI AdvantageThis isn't just a chatbot tacked onto a store. We integrated LangChain and LangGraph deeply into the backend logic to create an agent that takes meaningful action.User: "I need an outfit for a summer outdoor wedding, budget is around $150."AI Agent: Understands context, filters catalog by style/season/price, selects complementary items, and automatically adds them to the cart.
  <br />
  <br />
  🏗️ System ArchitectureWe moved beyond the monolith to ensure maintainability and resilience. The backend is split into decoupled microservices handling distinct domains:Auth Service (Role-based identity management)Product Catalog (Inventory and Search)Cart/Order Management (Transactional flows)AI Orchestration (LangGraph Logic)
  <br />
  <br />
